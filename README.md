# Bird Watch Counter

## About the project

This project was made for and used by me to take part in the [RSPB's Big Garden Bird watch](https://www.rspb.org.uk/get-involved/activities/birdwatch/), which takes place every year at the end of January. It is a research project undertaken by RSPB to find out how well bird populations are doing.
I created this project this project for personal use at home, but I think it would fun to be used as a bird counter for when you are out and about. I ued this to practice using JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

## Tech used

It was created using HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox and Vanilla JavaScript.
The features are, clickable buttons to add or subtract from the total, a submit button which will display your total findings as a list within a popup box. This submit button also fires confetti. (Confetti is from [Catdad](https://github.com/catdad/canvas-confetti)).
